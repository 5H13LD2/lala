# 🚀 Quick Start: Upload SQL Challenges to Firebase (5 Minutes)

## 📍 You Are Here
You have JSON files but can't see them in Firebase Firestore.

## 🎯 Goal
Upload 10 SQL challenges to Firebase so your app can fetch and display them.

---

## ⚡ Fastest Method: Firebase Console (Copy-Paste)

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to: **https://console.firebase.google.com/**
2. Click your project
3. Click **"Firestore Database"** in left menu

### Step 2: Go to Collection
- If `technical_assesment` exists → Click it
- If not → Click **"Start collection"** → Name it `technical_assesment`

### Step 3: Upload First Challenge

1. Click **"Add document"** button
2. Click the **"{ } Code"** button (top-right corner)
3. Open this file: `firebase_data/sql_challenge_01_select_all.json`
4. **Select ALL** and **Copy** the content
5. **Paste** into Firebase
6. In "Document ID" field, type: `sql_01`
7. Click **"Save"**

✅ **You just uploaded your first challenge!**

### Step 4: Upload Remaining 9 Challenges

Repeat Step 3 for each file:

| File | Document ID |
|------|-------------|
| `sql_challenge_01_select_all.json` | `sql_01` |
| `sql_challenge_02_where_filter.json` | `sql_02` |
| `sql_challenge_03_select_columns.json` | `sql_03` |
| `sql_challenge_04_order_by.json` | `sql_04` |
| `sql_challenge_05_count.json` | `sql_05` |
| `sql_challenge_06_avg.json` | `sql_06` |
| `sql_challenge_07_inner_join.json` | `sql_07` |
| `sql_challenge_08_group_by.json` | `sql_08` |
| `sql_challenge_09_having.json` | `sql_09` |
| `sql_challenge_10_subquery.json` | `sql_10` |

**Pro Tip**: Keep Firebase Console and your text editor side-by-side for faster copying!

## ✅ Verify Upload

After uploading all 10:

1. You should see 10 documents in `technical_assesment` collection
2. Click on `sql_01`
3. You should see fields like:
   - `title`: "Select All Students"
   - `difficulty`: "Easy"
   - `status`: "active"
   - `expected_result` (expand this)
   - `sample_table` (expand this)

### 🔍 Critical Check:

Expand: `expected_result` → `rows` → `0`

**✅ CORRECT** - You see:
```
▼ 0 (array)
    0: 1 (number)
    1: "Jerico" (string)
    2: 20 (number)
```

**❌ WRONG** - You see:
```
0: "[1, "Jerico", 20]" (string)
```

If you see the WRONG format, you didn't use the **"{ } Code"** button. Delete and try again using JSON mode!

---

## 🎉 Success!

Once you see all 10 documents with correct structure:

### Test in Your App:

1. Run your Android app
2. Add a button to launch SQL Challenges:
```kotlin
startActivity(Intent(this, AllSQLChallengesActivity::class.java))
```
3. You should see 10 challenges listed!

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "I don't see the { } Code button"
- Look at the **top-right** of the "Add document" dialog
- It's next to the "Save" and "Cancel" buttons
- It toggles between "Fields" view and "Code" view

### "Permission Denied"
- Check Firestore Rules → Temporarily allow writes for authenticated users
- Make sure you're logged into Firebase Console with the right account

### "Challenges not showing in app"
- Make sure you added the Activities to AndroidManifest.xml
- Verify user is logged in (Firebase Auth)
- Check Firestore rules allow reads
